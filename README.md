# About this project

This is my first attempt at creating a mobile app using [Ionic](http://ionicframework.com/)
It's a simple app that lets a user enter their weight and height to get their BMI value

## How to test the app

If you would like to test the app yourself on an Android or iOS device follow this simple guide:

1. Download the application `Ionic View` on [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ionic-view/id849930087?ls=1&mt=8) or [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ionic.viewapp)
2. Start the app and sign in or sign up if you're a new user
3. Once signed in, click the 'Preview App' button and enter the ID: `7cdd712e`
4. All done! You can now play around with the app
